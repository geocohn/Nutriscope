Press any item to show details about the product. The detail view includes three sections:
- DESCRPTION: details about categories, labels, brands, stores, locations, and packaging.
- INGREDIENTS: a list of ingredients with possible allergens highlighted, a list of possible allergens, a list of traces, a list of additives, and a photo of the ingredients list on the physical package.
- NUTRITION: nutrition levels for 100g followed by amounts for energy, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, salt, and fiber.

On smaller devices the sections appear in a tabbed view. On larger wide devices they appear in a single page.
